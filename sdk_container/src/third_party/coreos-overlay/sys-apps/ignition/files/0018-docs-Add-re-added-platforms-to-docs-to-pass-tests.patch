 * Bare Metal - Use the `ignition.config.url` kernel parameter to provide a URL to the configuration. The URL can use the `http://`, `https://`, `tftp://`, `s3://`, or `gs://` schemes to specify a remote config or the `oem://` scheme to specify a local config, rooted in `/usr/share/oem`.
 * [Brightbox] (`brightbox`) - Ignition will read its configuration from the instance userdata. Cloud SSH keys are handled separately.
