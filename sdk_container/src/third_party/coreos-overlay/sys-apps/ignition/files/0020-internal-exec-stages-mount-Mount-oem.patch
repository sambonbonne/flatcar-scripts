Subject: [PATCH 20/20] internal/exec/stages/mount: Mount /oem

When asking to mount the OEM partition to /usr/share/oem, actually
mount it in /oem. The /usr/share/oem is a symlink pointing to /oem, so
the ignition config (or container linux config) trying to put stuff
into /usr/share/oem, should end up having things in /oem.
